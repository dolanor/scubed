  <H2><A name="intro">Introduction</A></H2>With <A href=
  "www.rubberhose.org">rubberhose</A> (wayback machine <A href=
  "http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.rubberhose.org">search</A>)
  gone, <A href="http://www.mcdonald.org.uk/StegFS/">stegfs</A>
  vast asleep and <A href=
  "http://www.freenet.org.nz/phonebook/">phonebook</A> having a
  (IMHO) weird and complex architecture (and dependencies on
  <A href="http://sf.net/projects/avf">fuse</A> and <A href=
  "http://python.org/">Python</A>), the GNU/Linux user wanting
  plausibe deniability is at a loss. Until now...

  <P>Let me introduce the Simple Steganographics Store:</P>

  <UL>
    <LI>Simple, the program is small, easy to understand, maintain
    and use.</LI>

    <LI>Steganographic, it should provide the user with <A href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniability">deniable</A>
    encryption.</LI>

    <LI>Store, it can be read from and written to through
    blockdevices</LI>
  </UL>

  <P><B>WARNING: You should see this program as an unreviewed
  bug-ridden hack. If you seriously need deniable encryption and
  you want to use this program, you are free to do so, but you
  should put it up for technical and legal review. Don't trust the
  stuff you read here, even though IANAL. Don't say I didn't warn
  you.</B></P>

  <P>How is plausibe deniability implemented? First some
  terminoligy. There is a raw device which contains the encrypted
  data. Using <CODE>cryptsetup</CODE> and <CODE>scubed</CODE> you
  can create at most between 512 and 1024 cryptographic views on
  the raw device. I will call those cryptographic views
  partitions.</P>

  <P>Suppose you use scubed on a DVD+RW which can hold 4.377 GB.
  You have a partition of 2 GB, one of 1 GB and one of 600MB. This
  leaves about 0.791 GB of free space.</P>

  <P>Now someone demands your encryption keys, this someone cannot
  see how many partitions you have, so you could give the keys to
  the first two partitions and claim that the rest is free space
  (reserved for a new partition or for expansion of an existing
  partition to enlarge the filesystem it contains).</P>

  <P>Without the right passphrases even <CODE>scubed</CODE> itself
  can't say if the free space is truly free or is partly occupied
  by a hidden partition. This is why you need to tell
  <CODE>scubed</CODE> about <I>all</I> your partitions before you
  enlarge a partition or create a new one.</P>

  <P>A small tutorial is contained in the README file.</P>

  <H2><A name="download">Download</A></H2>The latest development
  version of this program lives in a subversion repository which
  can be browsed using <A href=
  "http://cube.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?root=scubed">viewcvs</A>.
  Also there is public read-only access to the repository. If you
  have installed <A href=
  "http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</A>, the source can be
  checked out by typing <CODE>svn checkout
  http://cube.dyndns.org/svn/scubed/trunk scubed</CODE>. This
  command will create a directory <CODE>scubed/</CODE> in the
  current directory and populate it with files.
