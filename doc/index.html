<H2><A name="intro">Introduction</A></H2>

With <a href=www.rubberhose.org>rubberhose</a> (wayback machine <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.rubberhose.org">search</a>) gone, <a href="http://www.mcdonald.org.uk/StegFS/">stegfs</a> vast asleep and <a href="http://www.freenet.org.nz/phonebook/">phonebook</a> having a (IMHO) weird and complex architecture (and dependencies on <a href="http://sf.net/projects/avf">fuse</a> and <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>), the GNU/Linux user wanting plausibe deniability is at a loss. Until now...

<P>
Let me introduce the Simple Steganographics Store:

<UL>
<LI>Simple, the program is small, easy to understand, maintain and use.</LI>
<LI>Steganographic, it should provide the user with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniability">deniable</a> encryption.</LI>
<LI>Store, it can be read from and written to through blockdevices</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>WARNING: You should see this program as an unreviewed bug-ridden hack.
If you seriously need deniable encryption and you want to use this program, you
are free to do so, but you should put it up for technical and legal review.
Don't trust the stuff you read here, even though IANAL. Don't say I didn't warn
you.</B>

<P>How is plausibe deniability implemented? First some terminoligy. There is a
raw device which contains the encrypted data. Using <code>cryptsetup</code> and
<code>scubed</code> you can create at most between 512 and 1024 cryptographic
views on the raw device. I will call those cryptographic views partitions.

<P>Suppose you use scubed on a DVD+RW
which can hold 4.377 GB. You have a partition of 2 GB, one of 1 GB and one of 600MB. This leaves about 0.791 GB of free space.

<P>Now someone demands your encryption keys, this someone cannot see how many
partitions you have, so you could give the keys to the first two partitions and
claim that the rest is free space (reserved for a new partition or for
expansion of an existing partition to enlarge the filesystem it contains).

<P>Without the right passphrases even <code>scubed</code> itself can't say if
the free space is truly free or is partly occupied by a hidden partition. This
is why you need to tell <code>scubed</code> about <i>all</i> your partitions
before you enlarge a partition or create a new one.

<P>A small tutorial is contained in the README file.

The latest development version of this program lives in a subversion repository
which can be browsed using <a href="http://cube.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?root=scubed">viewcvs</a>. Also there is public read-only access to
the repository. If you have installed <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">
subversion</a>, the source can be checked out by typing <CODE>svn checkout 
http://cube.dyndns.org/svn/scubed/trunk scubed</CODE>. This command will 
create a directory <CODE>scubed/</CODE> in the current directory and populate
it with files.
