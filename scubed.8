.SH NAME
scubed \- program to create, access and manage hidden volumes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scubed [-V] [-v] [-f] [-m|-M <name>|-r <device#>,<blocks>] <device> ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B scubed
allows you to create hidden volumens, hereafter 'scubed partitions',
on a regular blockdevice. Without it's passphrase (and without a history
of changes on the harddisk surface...) it is impossible to prove that
a given partition exists.

from a script.
.TP
.B \-m
Make a dm-linear table to linearize
.B <device>
and send it to standard output,
only one device may be given on the commandline.
.TP
.B \-M <name>
Make a device with name
.B /dev/mapper/<name>
being the linearized version of
.B <device>,
only one device may be given on the commandline.
.TP
.B \-r <device#>,<blocks>
Resize the partition on the, by
.B <device#>
, referenced device to
.B <blocks>
blocks. 

WARNING: If you enlarge a scubed partition, you must list all devices that
contain scubed partitions on the commmandline, otherwise you will lose
data.
